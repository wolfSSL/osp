# wolfSSL Open Source Project Ports with wolfProvider

The goal of the wolfProvider project is to replace the crypto used by OpenSSL
with wolfCrypt or wolfCrypt FIPS, with the least amount of changes possible.

Each of the project directories contains a patch file for a specific version of the Open
Source Project.

To apply a patch file, change to the project's directory and run
`patch -p1 < /path/to/PROJ-patch.txt`. Build the project normally.

The projects supported are:

| Directory | Project | Repository |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
